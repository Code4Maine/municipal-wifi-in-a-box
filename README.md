Abstract
--------
  High-speed internet access has become as basic to our present economy as electricity would have been in the last century. It stands to reason then, that this critical infrastructure should be equally accessible to the public at large, as would be the case with a public utility or the Interstate highway system. Instead,the vast majority of high speed internet users , this basic necessity can only be accessed has been monopolized by the entertainment industry, and priced accordingly. 
  Relying on Comcast for High Speed Internet is like paying Nascar to use the Turnpike.
  In Maine, many rural areas still do not have reliable access to high speed internet. Even more people do not have access to affordable high speed internet. The state is largely covered by Time Warner Cable, soon to be Comcast. Both companies have a standard operating practice of wooing customers
in with deeply discounted subscriptions, and then slowly bring the price up to what it's actually going to cost for the life of the connection over 18-24 months.

It's not uncommon to pay north of $100 per month for a farily middling (by
today's standards) 20 Mbit connection. And that after starting at something
more like $50 for the first 12 months.

Meanwhile, advances in ultra high-speed, gigabit internet and new grassroots approaches to community wireless are already disrupting the old way of doing things.

Instead of complaining about it, we're doing something about it. Thankfully, in
states like Maine, municipalities still maintain the right to setup their own telecommunications network.  Likewise, a new federally-funded ultra-high speed, "Gigabit" network,now in operation across the state includes a mandate

Unfortunately, the details and legal requirements of this process are not well
understood my most people, let alone the leadership of the small towns and
cities of Maine who's businesses and citizens stand to benefit the most from
healthy competition in the telecommunications marketplace.

We want to make municipal wifi a rubber stamp process. By compiling a 
professionally-prepared  kit providing documentation, hardware, support staff
requirements and maintenance over time, the hope is to have an easy to 
understand document that enables municipal governments to take the first
step towards providing an affordable and modern telecommunications network
for their citizens.

Vision & Mission
----------------
A new model being pioneered by towns like Rockport ME finally realizes the foundational dream of an "information superhighway".   wherein the core high-speed infrastructure is financed publically, but still requires private/non-profit/low-profit entities to deliver services to consumers. By combining this model with the peer to peer, mesh network advocated by Commotion Wireless, a new opportunity exists to utlize public access mandates for community broadcasting as a means for certain populations to access high speed internet as a public utility.

Our vision is a telecommunications landscape in Maine where major commercial
carriers in rural areas no longer enjoy a monopoly but can compete for their customers business
against high-quality wireless networks operated by municipalities.

Our mission is to provide municipalities in Maine with an implementable 
roadmap for municipal-funded wireless telecommunications networks for
